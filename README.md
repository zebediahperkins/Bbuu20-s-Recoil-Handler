<h1>Bbuu20's Recoil Handler</h1>
<a href="https://bbuu20-scripting.herokuapp.com/">bbuu20.com</a>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is the source code for a recoil "script" I made for the video game Rust. It uses a windows forms user interface to constantly poll for input from the user, and then makes decisions based on any input change.</p>

<h2>Bbuu20Api/bbuu20-scripting</h2>
<p>The script utilizes a basic login system that communicates with my web api to check if a user exists within the mongodb database. If the user does exist, it then checks if the user is currently logged in. If the user is logged in, all instances are suspended, and the user is asked to sign in again.</p>

<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
<p>The script uses hotkeys for quickly switching weapons, even while the script is not in focus.</p>

<h2>Keybinds</h2>
<p>The script also has a keybind feature which allows users to change their hotkey values, allowing for much greater customization.</p>
